=== Options

There are a number of options that affect how a copy behaves. There options are

  cp url_src, url_dest,
    overwrite : false,

When the source is a folder a filter can also be used to control which files are copied. Internally filters are
converted to `FileSelector` objects. If no filter is supplied, then the behaviour is the same as if `Selectors.SELECT_ALL`
has been supplied. Filters return two results

* Whether the file should be included
* If the source file is a actually a folder, whether its descendants should be traversed

Filters can be one of the following:

* Regex pattern - This can be a `Pattern` class or a `String`. This is matched against the basename of a source file.
Traversal will always occur.
* `FileSelector`
* Ant-style pattern
